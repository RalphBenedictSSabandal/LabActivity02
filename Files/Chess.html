          <li>I have great appreciation for the middle game in chess.</li>
          <li>Unlike the earlygame and endgame which require a lot of theory and memorization, the 
          middle game is where the fun lies, and where most of the solving is.</li>
          <li>My favorite point guards are Stephen Curry and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.</li>
          <li>However, I usually play the center position.</li>
